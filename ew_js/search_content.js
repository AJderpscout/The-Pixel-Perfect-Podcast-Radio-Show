I am your host and resident gamer, DJ Sine. I am a gamer who has refound their love for video games by taking a step back from the toxicity found in most multiplayer games. There are so many amazing single player experiences that are seemingly untapped by the mass majority of gamers. I plan on giving recomendations, discussing aspects of games like sound and graphics, and reporting the latest news in the video game scene. Some of my favorite video games are: Celeste, Terraria, Subnautica, Papers Please, Call of Duty Black Ops 1, Team Fortress 2, Titainfall 2, Payday 2, Rivals of Aether. Some of my favorite \"retro\" video games are: Pokemon Black, The Legend of Zelda, Metal Slug, Ms. Pac Man, Super Mario Bros 3, Conkers Bad Fur Day, Rhythm Heaven DS. From modern to retro, no game is safe from my exstensive rant!
